# Multiplayer
Better Version of my other multiplayer. I made this just to see whether I could make it. Its not meant to be professional or anything


To try this you need to host the index.js somewhere with Node.js and then enter the ip into the server_ip.txt file. Host the html, js and css files as well and run the html file and it wil connect to the Node.js server.

Once you have loaded in, you have to type your name and choose your avatar color. Then you can use the joystick to move around. To send messages you can click on thr button located in the top-right of the screen and u can deal damage to people with the button on the right bottom of the screen. Its meant to be very simple, there isn't a motive to the game (YET!)
